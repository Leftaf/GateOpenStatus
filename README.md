## Secure Your Home with CCTV Integration by check the status of your main gate
Are you concerned about unauthorized access to your property or unexpected movement around your home? Integrating your existing CCTV cameras in your security environment can offer a robust solution for monitoring and enhancing your home security.

+ Live Monitoring:

  + This enables you to keep an eye on things remotely, whether you're away from home or simply checking in for peace of mind.
 
+ Motion Detection:

  + Configure your cameras and Home Assistant to trigger alerts upon detecting motion within designated areas.
  + Receive instant notifications on your phone or other devices, allowing you to investigate potential security breaches promptly.
 
+ Automation:

  + Combine motion detection with smart home devices like lights or sirens to create automated responses.
  + For example, upon detecting motion at night, lights could automatically switch on, deterring potential intruders.
 
This program aims to deliver exceptional accuracy in detecting the main gate's open and closed states, even under challenging conditions. It addresses scenarios where shadows or small animals crossing the camera's view might lead to misinterpretations. To achieve this, the program incorporates three additional switches, specifically designed to enhance the reliability of the gate status information. This innovative approach ensures you receive clear and dependable notifications about your gate's position, fostering greater peace of mind and security.
